<h2>Lifting</h2>
<p>
Weightlifting has been a part of my dailey routine for a while and has been an outlet for me to vent my stress

<h2>Running</h2>
<p>
I love running because it keeps me grounded and improves my endurance and heart health. 
Running is one of those things that puts me in a calm state of mind and allows for my mind to run free. 
It is another thing that has helped me improve my stress levels and push my mind at the same time.

<h2>Skiing</h2>
<p>
I love carving down the mountain and enjoying winter in the best way possible. 
The winter can be a time of year that is challanging because of a lack of activities that people can do. 
Living in Utah allows people to still get outdoors to the ski resourts and is something that has been a relief for me in the winter.
